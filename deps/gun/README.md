Gun
===

Gun is an asynchronous SPDY, HTTP and Websocket client.

Goals
-----

Gun aims to provide an **easy to use** client compatible with
HTTP, SPDY and Websocket.

Gun is **always connected**. It will maintain a permanent
connection to the server, reopening it as soon as the server
closes it, saving time for the requests that come in.

All connections are **supervised** automatically, allowing
the developer to focus on writing his code without worrying.

Sponsors
--------

The development of the Gun project is sponsored
by [LeoFS Cloud Storage](http://www.leofs.org).
